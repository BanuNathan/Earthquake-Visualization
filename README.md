# United States Geological Survey

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day. Being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet. So here is the interactive visualization of the earthquake data they have collected in the past one week. 

   * A map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers will reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. 
   
   * Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

   *  Popups will provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Legend that will provided with the context for the map data.
